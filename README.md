# Book_Recommender

This is a simple book recommender, built by using cosine similarity.

The data was scraped from https://books.toscrape.com/index.html and compiled into a csv, names Books.csv.

The script is pretty straighforwards using NLTK, sklearn and Pandas. 

The requirements.txt file has the libraries used and the main.py file is the one used to build and run the app. 

The recommender can be greatly improved such as, you can use categories and authors as well. 

Open to any issues or improvement advices <3
