# Book_Recommender

This is a simple book recommender, built by using cosine similarity.

The data was scraped from https://books.toscrape.com/index.html and compiled into a csv.

The script is pretty straighforwards using NLTK, sklearn and Pandas. 

The recommender can be greatly improved such as, you can use categories and authors as well. 

Open to any issues or improvement advices <3
